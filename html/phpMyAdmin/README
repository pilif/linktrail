  Requirements: 
    PHP3
    MySQL (tested with 3.21.x, 3.22.x and 3.23.x, works also in 3.20.x, 
          but in this case the "SHOW" commands should be commented out in 
          index.php3)
    a web-browser (doh!)
                
  Summary:
    phpMyAdmin is intended to handle the adminstration of MySQL over the WWW.
    Currently it can:
    - create and drop databases
    - create, copy, drop and alter tables
    - delete, edit and add fields
    - execute any SQL-statement, even batch-queries
    - manage keys on fields
    - load text files into tables
    - create and read dumps of tables
    - export and import CSV data
    - administer one single database

  Credits:
    This work is based on Peter Kuppelwieser's MySQL-Webadmin. It was his idea 
    to create a web-based interface to MySQL using PHP3. Although I have not
    used any of his source-code, there are some concepts I've borrowed from 
    him. phpMyAdmin was created because Peter told me he wasn't going to further 
    develop his (great) tool.
    Thanks go to 
    - Amalesh Kempf <ak-lsml@living-source.com> who contributed the code for 
      the check when dropping a table or database. He also suggested that you
      should be able to specify the primary key on tbl_create.php3. To version
      1.1.1 he contributed the ldi_*.php3-set (Import text-files) as well as
      a bug-report. Plus many smaller improvements.
    - Jan Legenhausen <jan@nrw.net>: He made many of the changes that were
      introduced in 1.3.0 (including quite significant ones like the 
      authentification). For 1.4.1 he enhanced the table-dump feature. Plus
      bug-fixes and help.
    - Marc Delisle <DelislMa@CollegeSherbrooke.qc.ca> made phpMyAdmin language-
      independent by outsourcing the strings to a separate file. He also
      contributed the French translation.
    - Alexandr Bravo <abravo@hq.admiral.ru> who contributed tbl_select.php3,
      a feature to display only some fields from a table.
    - Chris Jackson <chrisj@ctel.net> added support for MySQL functions in 
      tbl_change.php3. He also added the "Query by Example" feature in 2.0.
    - Dave Walton <walton@nordicdms.com> added support for multiple servers and
      is a regular contributor for bug-fixes.
    The following people have contributed minor changes, enhancements, bugfixes
    or support for a new language:
    Jim Kraai, Jordi Bruguera, Miquel Obrador, Geert Lund, Thomas Kleemann, Alexander Leidinger,
    Kiko Albiol, Daniel C. Chao, Pavel Piankov, Sascha Kettler, Joe Pruett, 
    Renato Lins, Mark Kronsbein, Jannis Hermanns.

    And thanks to everyone else who sent me email with suggestions, bug-reports and
    or just some feedback.

      PHP3 with MySQL-support". I do answer all emails regarding 
      phpMyAdmin, but I just don't have the time to be your free helpdesk.

phpMyAdmin - Installation

  Preface:
    phpMyAdmin can administer a whole MySQL-server (needs a super-user) 
    but also a single database. To accomplish the latter you'll need
    a properly set up MySQL-user who can read/write only the desired
    database. It's up to you to look up the appropiate part in the 
    MySQL manual.

  Quick Install:
    [1] Untar the distribution (be sure to untar the subdirectories)
        tar xvf phpMyAdmin_x.x.x.tar
    [2] Open the file config.inc.php3 in your favourite editor and change
        the values for host, user and password to fit your environment.
        Have a lok at Documentation.html for an explanation of all values.
    [3] It is recommended that you protect the directory in which
        you installed phpMyAdmin (unless it's on a closed intranet), 
        for example with HTTP-AUTH (in a .htaccess-file). 
    [4] Open the file <www.your-host.com>/<your-install-dir>/index.php3
        in your browser. phpMyAdmin should now display a welcome screen 
        and your databases.

  Installation notes:
  + Be sure to protect the phpMyAdmin-directory. By default, it is not 
    protected in any way! It shouldn't be readable by anyone and 
    especially not by search-engines. Although I've added a "nofollow" 
    directive on every page, there may be search-engines that don't 
    care about that and still follow the links on the page. 
    Think of AltaVista following a link named "Drop Database"
    You can get an overview of Apache's authentification methods at
    http://www.apacheweek.com/features/userauth . Another tutorial is at

  + PHP3 should be configured to have magic_quotes=on. In the module
    version of PHP3 this can also be set on a per-directory base with 
    php3_magic_quotes_gpc on in an .htaccess file or in your Apache's
    access.conf.
  + If you don't use the extension ".php3" for your scripts, you can use
    the bundled script "extchg.sh" to modify phpMyAdmin (or any other script)
    to work with a different extension. Beware though, that currently changing 
    the extension from .html to something other won't work (it'd change all 
    "string".htmlspecialchars() constructs).

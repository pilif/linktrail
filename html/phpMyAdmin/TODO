phpMyAdmin - Todo

Todo sometime in the future:
  + a stupid-user mode to allow a novice user adminstrate
    a database on his own without having the possibility
    to mess it up completely.
  + use an db-abstraction layer to support other dbs?
    (I won't do this as I don't have access to many other
    db-systems right now and I'm not going to install
    one for this purpose.) You'd be welcome though if you want
    to go for it.
  + I'd like to see an overview of the relations between
    tables in a database (sort of entity relationship diagram).

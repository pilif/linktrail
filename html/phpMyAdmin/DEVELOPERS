phpMyAdmin - Developer's Information

 phpMyAdmin is Open Source, so you're invited to contribute to it.
 Many great features have been written by other people and you too
 can help to make phpMyAdmin a useful tool.
 
 If you're planning to contribute source, please read the following 
 information:
 
 + All files include header.inc.php3 (layout), lib.inc.php3 (common functions)
   and config.inc.php3. All configuration data belongs in config.inc.php3. 
   Please keep it free from other code. 
   Commonly used functions should be added to lib.inc.php3.
 + Obviously, you're free to use whatever coding style you want. But please
   try to keep your code as simple as possible: beginners are using phpMyAdmin
   as an example application.
 + Please try to keep up the file-naming conventions. Table-related stuff
   goes to tbl_*.php3, db-related code to db_*.php3 and so on.
 + Please don't use verbose strings in your code, instead add the string
   (at least) to english.inc.php3 and print() it out. 
 + If you want to be really helpful, write an entry for the ChangeLog.
 
 IMPORTANT:
  With 1.4.1, development has switched to CVS. 
  The following method is preferred for new developers:
  - fetch the current CVS tree over anonymous CVS:
    cvs -d :pserver:anon@www.htmlwizard.net:/usr/local/cvsroot login
    [Password: phpMyAdmin]
    cvs -d :pserver:anon@www.htmlwizard.net:/usr/local/cvsroot checkout phpMyAdmin
    [This will create a new sub-directory named phpMyAdmin]
  - add your stuff
  - send me the file you've modified
  I've also set up CVSWEB on http://www.htmlwizard.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb.
  Write access to the CVS tree is granted only to developers who have already
  contributed something useful to phpMyAdmin.  If you're interested in that, 
  please contact me.

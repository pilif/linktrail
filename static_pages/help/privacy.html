Linktrail has a firm commitment to privacy. As we are based in Zurich, Switzerland, we 
adhere to the strict swiss legislation for person data privacy (Bundesgesetz &uuml;ber den 
Datenschutz, DSG, June 19th 1992, amended July 7th 1998). We will apply the same principles 
when offering our services to you - our dear users outside of Switzerland. Because diverse 
privacy seal programs have unfortunately failed in the attempt to protect user's online privacy, 
we formulate the following straightforward privacy policy.
<p>
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web 
site. We also use cookies to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time 
you visit our site and to administer your session with our service. You can be assured that 
we do not track or record your movements on our site.
<p>
Our site's registration form requires users to give us a user name, a password and a valid 
Email address. We do not ask you to enter any demographic information. You can supply 
demographic information on a volunteer basis to linktrail and to other users by adding it 
to your {PERSONAL_PROFILE} on your {MYPAGE}. We use your Email address to send you information 
about our company and to send you Email about updates in trails. Before receiving any Email messages 
from us, you will expressely have to opt-in to this feature in your {PERSONAL_PREFERENCES}. We use the 
demographic data you supply volunterely in your {PERSONAL_PROFILE} to suggest you trails tailored to 
your interests on your {MYPAGE}.
<p>
The linktrail Web site contains links to other sites. Linktrail is not responsible for the 
privacy practices or the general business practices of such Web site hosters.
<p>
Without your expressly given consent, we will never pass on or make public your personally 
identifiable information to any third parties, nor for free nor for exchange nor for money. 
<p>
<b>Security</b>
<br>
While designing our service we have taken all security measures available to protect the loss, 
misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All of our servers are protected 
against drive failures and are backed up nightly. Our machines are built around a secure 
framework, so your personal information cannot be accessed by anyone but you. Of course, we 
are not completely immune to malicious attacks on our data systems.
<p>
<b>Opt-in</b>
<br>
Linktrail does not ask you to opt-out of anything - contrarily, we ask for your explicit 
permission before sending you any Email. We adhere to a strict opt-in Email policy.
<p>
<b>Correct / Update</b>
<br>
User information can always be changed or modified by adjusting your {PERSONAL_PROFILE}.
